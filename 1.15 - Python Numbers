Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:
int
float
complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

Example
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
Example
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

Random Number
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
Example
Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random
print(random.randrange(1, 10))
